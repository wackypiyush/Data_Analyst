Paradigm Shift by HTML5 UP

Say hello to Paradigm Shift, my first addition to HTML5 UP in more than a year (!!!).
Took things in a slightly different direction with this one, partly to mess with CSS
grid (which this one relies on pretty heavily) but mostly to get back to making weirder
and more experimental designs/layouts. Anyway, hope you dig it, and thanks for the
continued support despite the lack of updates :)
